# ColorTimer

[Visual color timer](http://sebastien.saunier.me/colortimer/)
implements the
[Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) in which
you work by batches of 25 minutes and rest for 5 minutes.

By clicking "Start", you'll launch a timer but won't get visual feedback
of the time spent except for the [colors](http://flatuicolors.com/):

1. 25:00 - 12:30 => Emerald
2. 12:30 - 06:15 => Peter Rover
3. 06:15 - 03:07 => Sun Flower
4. 03:07 - 01:33 => Pumpkin
5. 01:33 - 00:46 => Pomegranate
6. 00:46 - 00:00 => Black

And then it's time for a 5 minutes break!
